## Aggregate functions
Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on a group of rows and return a single value as output.
They are mostly used with GROUP BY to summarize data.

COUNT() → counts rows
SUM() → adds values
AVG() → finds average
MIN() → smallest value

## Clauses
Clauses are conditions/rules that control how queries run.
used with aggregation:

WHERE → filters rows before aggregation
GROUP BY → groups rows for aggregation
HAVING → filters groups after aggregation
ORDER BY → sorts the result
MAX() → largest value
