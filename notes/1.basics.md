## What is a Database?
A database is a place where data (information) is stored in an organized way so it can be easily found, used, and updated.
A database is like a digital cupboard 📂 where information is kept neatly so you can search and update it quickly.

## What is Data?
Data means any piece of information that can be stored, processed, or used.
It can be numbers, text, images, sounds, or facts collected for reference or analysis.
- A teacher writing student marks in a notebook → data.
- When marks are analyzed to find class topper → becomes information.

## What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to communicate with databases.
It helps us to store, search, update, and manage data inside a database.

## What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
It is a type of database software that stores data in the form of tables (rows and columns) and allows us to use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage the data.

### 🔑 Key Points
- SQL is used in Relational Databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
- It works with tables (rows & columns).
- It is easy to read because it uses English-like commands.

 #### 1. Open-Source RDBMS (Free to use and modify)
     MySQL – Widely used for web apps (WordPress, PHP, Node.js projects).
     PostgreSQL – Advanced, supports complex queries & JSON.
     MariaDB – Community-driven version of MySQL.
####  2.Commercial RDBMS (Paid (licensed), used by enterprises for large-scale secure systems)
    Oracle Database – Strong in big companies, banking, finance.
    Microsoft SQL Server – Common in corporate environments (Windows-based).
    IBM Db2 – Used in finance, healthcare, enterprise systems.

## Difference Between SQL and MySQL
| Feature             | **SQL**                                                         | **MySQL**                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Form**       | Structured Query Language                                       | MySQL (does not expand, but derived from “My” + “SQL”)                              |
| **Type**            | Language (used to communicate with databases)                   | Database Management System (RDBMS software)                                         |
| **What it Does**    | Defines rules/commands to create, read, update, and delete data | Uses SQL to store, manage, and organize data in tables                              |
| **Role**            | Standard language for querying databases                        | Software that implements SQL (and adds extra features)                              |
| **Examples**        | `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`          | MySQL Server where you create databases and run SQL queries                         |
| **Standardization** | SQL is standardized by ANSI/ISO                                 | MySQL is one of many RDBMS that use SQL (others are Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) |


- SQL = Language 📖 (like English grammar rules)
- MySQL = Software 💻 (like a book written using those grammar rules)
