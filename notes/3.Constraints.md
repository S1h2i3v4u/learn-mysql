## Constraints

- Primary Key
- Foreign Key
- Candidate Key
- Composite Key
- Unique
- Not Null
- Default
- Check


# 1. Primary Key → Main identifier
- It’s like a unique roll number of a student in school.
- No two students can have the same roll number, and it cannot be empty.

👉 Example:
student_id in a Students table.


# 2. Foreign Key → Link between tables

- It’s like saying: “This student joined Course ID 101”.
- The Course ID must exist in the Courses table first.
- It connects two tables together.

👉 Example:
In an Enrollments table, course_id points to Courses.course_id.

# 3. Composite Key → Combination of two things to make unique
- Sometimes one thing is not enough to identify.
- Like: An order number + a product ID → together they make it unique.
- Example: If order 101 has product A and product B, we need both to identify each row.

👉 Example:
(order_id, product_id) together.

# 4. Candidate Key → Options for Primary Key
- Think of it like: in a class, a student can be identified by roll number, email, or phone number → all are unique.
- These are all candidates.
- But the teacher chooses roll number as the official Primary Key.

👉 Example:
In Employees: emp_id, email, phone → all unique → all are candidate keys.
