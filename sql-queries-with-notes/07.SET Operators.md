<img width="1276" height="995" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27aa985d-2e86-4f35-9640-0898d35cdc74" />

- Set operators are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries.
- They work on the result sets (not on tables directly).

| Operator           | Description                                                               | MySQL Support                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UNION**          | Combines results of two queries and removes duplicates.                   | ✅ Supported                                                             |
| **UNION ALL**      | Combines results of two queries and keeps duplicates.                     | ✅ Supported                                                             |
| **INTERSECT**      | Returns only rows common to both queries.                                 | ❌ Not directly supported (can simulate using `INNER JOIN` or `IN`).     |
| **EXCEPT / MINUS** | Returns rows from the first query that are **not present** in the second. | ❌ Not directly supported (can simulate using `LEFT JOIN … WHERE NULL`). |

## Rules
- Both queries must return the same number of columns.
- The data types of columns must match (or be similar).
- The column names come from the first query.
- ORDER BY can be used only at the end of the whole result.
- UNION removes duplicates, UNION ALL keeps duplicates.
- Use parentheses if mixing more than one set operator.

| Feature         | **UNION**                                                    | **UNION ALL**                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duplicates**  | Removes duplicates (returns only distinct rows).             | Keeps duplicates (shows all rows).                    |
| **Performance** | Slower (because it has to check and remove duplicates).      | Faster (no duplicate check).                          |
| **Result Size** | Result set may be smaller because duplicates are eliminated. | Result set may be larger because duplicates are kept. |
| **Use Case**    | When you need **unique results** only.                       | When you want **all results including duplicates**.   |


# 2] UNION ALL
```
SELECT product_id FROM orderDetails
UNION ALL
