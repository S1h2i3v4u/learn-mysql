# SET Operator
- Set operators are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries.
- They work on the result sets (not on tables directly).

| Operator           | Description                                                               | MySQL Support                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UNION**          | Combines results of two queries and removes duplicates.                   | ✅ Supported                                                             |
| **UNION ALL**      | Combines results of two queries and keeps duplicates.                     | ✅ Supported                                                             |
| **INTERSECT**      | Returns only rows common to both queries.                                 | ❌ Not directly supported (can simulate using `INNER JOIN` or `IN`).     |
| **EXCEPT / MINUS** | Returns rows from the first query that are **not present** in the second. | ❌ Not directly supported (can simulate using `LEFT JOIN … WHERE NULL`). |
